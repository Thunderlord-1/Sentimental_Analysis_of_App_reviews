Ankit Dabral,"This is my second review after almost an year being a gold member with Lenden. Everytime you make any major changes to your app it ruins the experinece of the user. For instance, you just updated your app and everytime I have to login, I need to verify my mobile number. That is a bit tolerable if you look into the fact that it might have been done for security purposes. However, when an existing user is taken to a web browser instead of login in to the actual app, this eludes my understanding.",1,2022-08-08 15:25:48,3

qwerty ytrewq,I invested in late 2019. All I say is this mode of investing is fraught with risk. Initially they autoreinvested the cash I was getting without asking me & I complained but their support service is pathetic. In between they changed their policy increasing their share. I played smart & kept on withdrawing as it reached Rs 500 but after a crash my defaulters increased and there is no way to keep tab. Total I withdrawed Rs 6500 for an investment of Rs 10000. Now the RoR is showing negative.,1,2021-12-08 15:14:15,5

Invested 30K 1-1/2 years back. Now networth is ‚Çπ-316. Also no balance in my account to draw even ‚Çπ1. Also 25 loans written-off. Too big for normal investors. It's slow deteriorate for capital.

Narsinva Sawant,Useless investor app. They write off as per their own policy and does not put in any effort for recovering money from borrowers. Write off ratio is around 40% with this app so u'll never end up in profit. Who knows if in background they recover and keep the money for themselves. Stay away from the app and website. Only way u can end up in profit is to be so lucky that all your borrowers will pay on time if not then lenden is there to write it off. Really disappointed.

mopuri deepthi,Very high default rate. Once the loan is delayed it progresses to default and written off. Very poor recovery support. More than 20 percentage default rate. As long as you keep the money invested the returns rate will be high due to anticipated income . Once if you stop the fresh investments real returns will come out. Out of my 236 investments 30 loans are written off already and 10 loans are in default status which will become written off soon.,1,2021-03-08 02:35:16,39

In reality I invested in 100 loans and default rate for me is 30% and return is -25%.

Earlier we could just unchecked 48 percent and that would ensure that money is not lost in these defaulting assets. Just because you earn heavy commissions for 48% from borrowers you are pushing investors via ai mode to invest into them. That's a huge malpractice. Suddenly the 48% loans have gone up.

A Google user,As a lender it is guaranteed 99.99% that you will loose money with LenDen Insta Money. They don't have stringent process nor do they provide Legal support. It is down the drain scheme and LenDen will attribute it as highest risk category and suggest diversification. High risk does not mean poor evaluation or followup or no legal support. I'm forced to believe it is a an internal scheme of LenDen to make money. LenDen if you can't support then remove that category. You stand India no 1 in defaults,1,2019-06-05 06:44:00,17

Siddhant Bhawnani,I would not recommend anyone to invest in Faircent. Most of the borrowers never pay a single emi and the Faircent team does not even bother to follow up with them. They are least interested while you are losing your hard earned money. They just care about their commission and do not try to recover your money from defaulters.

If you paid Rs 500 Rs than they finishes the verification step by calling and asks to send documents even you uploaded that In app. After they rejects. Fraud one....,1,2020-06-01 16:38:32,1

A Google user,"What a waste of time. They give you false information regarding the loan. Once you pay the registration fees, there's no one available on the calling faircent so many times regarding the status of my loan, but i did not receive any call. They took 5 cheques from me, which was wasted as the loan was not disbursed. So, if you're not sure whether I'll get the loan or not, then you have no right to take away my cheques and take the registration fee. Basically you're making money by taking this fee and later informing them that the loan is not approved. I almost waited for a month for the loan. And your customer service is the worst service ever. My credit score is not bad, even my salary makes me eligible, then why the hell my loan was not disbursed. I had asked for a loan of 1.5 lakhs, they even reduced the amount to 1 lakh. Basically, your policies are not flexible at all and you harass your customers a lot. I'll never ever contact Faircent regarding anything. Your company should be banned from any sorts of business. You are a bunch of illiterate people who have opened up a company in order to extract money from your customers.",1,2018-02-17 16:13:02,4

Loan default rate is not easily available on the app. The details related to money are updated late on the app than the website. I am a user who only uses ap and they shall develop the app accordingly. Suggestions: I see all the loans on this platform are coming from NCR which means we are missing geographical diversification. I also noticed frequently there come loans for the employees of a single company, i.e. Yes Madam. This again puts investors at risk as the loans are skewed towards this company. Another this is there are lot of loans coming from MCD employees, which again reduces diversification and puts money at risk.",1,2018-10-16 04:48:48,11

They'll assign a wealth manager...for first few weeks you'll get prompt response from them but after that you'll never get response. If you are an investor better try to avoid this. It definitely attract you if you don't know where to invest..but honsetly be ready to loss your investment at least by 70%. Hope this review helps someone.,1,2021-12-12 04:09:50,8
